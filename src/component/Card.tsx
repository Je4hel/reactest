                    We imagined <strong>reactest</strong> to be used like a journal, or a logbook, in which you would simply put your thoughts. But when doing so, we surely wanted to bring that old logging habit inherited from sailors - <em>maybe earlier travelers, even!</em> - to the digital age.<br/>
                    What can it do? Well, its major strength is to log <strong>ideas</strong>. You can use easy <strong>formatting</strong> to help shape them for a better reading later and you can also add meta-data or <strong>external content</strong> such as images or files. Really, you can use it any way you want. You can even share it with your team!<br/>
                    The system is powered by a flexible <strong>search engine</strong> and all content is <strong>versioned</strong> so you can go back in time without messing with the timeline!<br/>
                    Anyhoo, the best is just to play around to see what it can actually do, rather than having us telling you functionalities and whatnots in boring bullet-point lists. But if you really like reading lists, then you can have a look at our exhaustive functionalities list over there.<br/>
                    If you decide that you like it - <em>and we sure hope you will!</em> - head to the download post to know how to get going.<br/>
                    See you around!
